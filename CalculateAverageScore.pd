problem

---------

Calculate the average score for each project, but only include projects where more than one team member has provided a score.Your output should include the project ID and the calculated average score for each qualifying project.



Approach

----------

Filtering: I group it by project_id and use filter to keep only projects with more than one score.

Calculating Averages: calculate the average score for each project by grouping again and using mean().


solution
---------
import pandas as pd

filtered_pd =project_data.groupby('project_id').filter(lambda x: len(x) > 1)
average_scores = filtered_pd .groupby('project_id')['score'].mean().reset_index()
