Problem_solution 
--------------------
You are analyzing a social network dataset at Google. Your task is to find mutual friends between two users, Karl and Hans. There is only one user named Karl and one named Hans in the dataset.The output should contain 'user_id' and 'user_name' columns.

Approach 
-----------
1) First, I filtered the users DataFrame to get the user_id for Karl and Hans.
2) Using the friends DataFrame, I extracted the friend_id list for both Karl and Hans.
3) By converting the friend lists to sets, I used intersection to identify mutual friends shared between Karl and Hans.
4) Finally, I filtered the users DataFrame with the mutual friend IDs to get the details of those shared connections.

import pandas as pd

users.head() 

friends.head() 
 
karl_id = users[users['user_name'] == 'Karl']['user_id'].iloc[0]
hans_id = users[users['user_name'] =='Hans']['user_id'].iloc[0]

karl_friends = friends[friends['user_id'] == karl_id ]['friend_id'].tolist()
hans_friends = friends[friends['user_id']== hans_id]['friend_id'].tolist()

mutual_friends = list(set(karl_friends).intersection(hans_friends))

users[users['user_id'].isin(mutual_friends)]
